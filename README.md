# Pokie-talkie API
![alt text](https://ctsd.github.io/pktk-bot/img/calculus.png "Pokie-talkie")

As a yound and wild Pokemon Go trainer, meeting and communicating with other trainers around was a big deal.

That's why I created an Facebook Messenger bot, acting as a talkie-walkie relaying messages to people also connected to that bot in a radius of 500meters.

### Technology

This is the repo of the API app, based on Ruby on Rails and the awesome, and that was previously hosted on Heroku.

The target of this API is to store users locations and identity, and cross them with any user location when he decides to broadcast a message.

It exchanges data with the bot app ([repo here](https://github.com/ctsd/pktk-bot)).
